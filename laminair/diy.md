Arrange the 4 main parts like so:

There should be two holes in red. That will be used for the handle later on. Also notice the two blue holes on the right. Those will be used for the container for the power bank & power switch.

Using an **M3x8mm hex screw**, screw the top left and bottom left pieces together.

Before going all the way, make sure to add the **M3 nut** at the bottom. Continue screwing until the two feel secure.

Add double sided tape:

Cut off the extra tape:

Connect the two filters:

Make sure the two black little pieces are sticking out in the middle (and not sticking to the double sided tape):

Insert the two combined filters, with the white side facing out:

Push them in so that they fit snugly with the main body.

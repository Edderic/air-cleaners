Arrange the 4 main parts like so:

There should be two holes in red. That will be used for the handle later on. Also notice the two blue holes on the right. Those will be used for the container for the power bank & power switch.

Using an **M3x8mm hex screw**, screw the top left and bottom left pieces together.

Before going all the way, make sure to add the **M3 nut** at the bottom. Continue screwing until the two feel secure.

Do the same thing for this section next:

Next, we work on connecting the bottom pieces togetherc

Insert the **M3 hex nut** before fully tightening:

The power switch has a **male** end and a **female** end. The **female** end should be in the main body, while the **male** end along with the **power switch** should be outside the main body. Insert the wire between the **female** end and the power switch into the groove of the bottom right part:

### Steps

Set the main body so the two holes for the straps are at the top:

Place the **handle** on the top of the main body:

Place a **washer** near one of the two holes:

Using the **M3 hex wrench**, wiggle the **washer** so that it's in between the rubber and the metal part:

Insert the **M3x8mm hex screw** and start screwing it in:

When half-way done, insert the **M3 hex nut** on the other side:

Screw as tight as possible:

Now do the same steps for the other side:

The challenging part here is aligning the **M3x8mm** screw so that it is perpendicular with the top of the main body.
You will have to push the loose end of the handle to make a curve so that the screw is perpendicular to the main body.Then hold that position while screwing the **M3x8mm** screw:

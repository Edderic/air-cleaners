# LaminAir V2

Effective personal air cleaning via laminar flow, meant to be used close to the face. In a matter of seconds, can give 5-to-13 exposure reduction factors (i.e. 80-93% reduction of aerosols) when breathing near the middle, 15-inches-or-less away from the face. Another effective tool to add to your arsenal of multilayer protections.

## Use cases

**Safer dental visits as a patient.**
The LaminAir V2 can be connected to a tripod to so you can breathe in concentrated clean air at the dentist or in the hospital. Get cleaner air wherever you go. LaminAir V2 can boost the protection of the [Readimask Nose hack](https://x.com/findmeabluebird/status/1517896018188197891).

**Safer working in the office.**
Sitting in a cubicle, or working at a desk while wearing a mask? LaminAir V2 can boost the effectiveness of respirators. The effect is multiplicative. For example, if you have a fit tested respirator that has a fit factor of 20, using a LaminAir in conjunction with a mask can gives a combined exposure reduction factor somewhere between 100 (20 x 5) and 260 (20 x 13). In other words, you will be breathing 100 to 260 times lower concentration of aerosols between 0.02 - 1 micron, when combining a mask with a fit factor of 20 with the LaminAir.

**Safer indoor dining.**
Have to eat indoors with a bunch of people? Reduce your risk of getting sick from airborne pathogens and get sick less often using the LaminAir V2.

## Features

**Easily adjustable**: Swivel design lets you easily point the device to your face.

**Versatile**: Can be used with a tripod to get cleaner air at the dentist.

**Rechargeable**: Powerbank included, USB-C rechargeable.

**Modular**: If a part breaks, that part can be easily replaced, without having the need to buy a whole new device.

3D-printed with PETG / PLA plastic.

Designed and Built in the U.S.

## Experimental Results on Efficacy

### Grid of exposure reduction factors
80-92% reduction (5-13 exposure reduction factors) in particles between 0.02 and 1 micron when used close to the face.

Look at a birds-eye view of exposure reduction factors:
![exposure reduction factors grid](https://breathesafe-llc.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/files/GZVDrBeW0AANzxP.png?v=1728439786)

| label | notes |
| - | - |
|X| corresponds to left and right movement of the head when facing the LaminAir V2. |
|Y| corresponds to moving closer or farther away from the LaminAir.|
|Z| is the height from the ground, kept constant in the middle. |

The graph above was produced by using a PortaCount 8020A. Ambient air was being sampled right in the intake of the device at the back and then compared to the cleaner air in the front:

Edderic moved the PortaCount sampling probe inch by inch to get the grid. Each position is a minute's worth of samples. So in total, Edderic spent more than two hours testing the device.

## DIY

If you have access to a 3D printer, and you are interested in printing out the pieces yourself to save on labor, please take a look at [the instructions](./diy/diy.md), which shows the 3D-printable parts in STL format.

If you already have the 3D printed parts and would like to assemble the pieces together, you can also take a look at [the instructions](./diy/diy.md).

The rest of the pieces are listed
[here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wJ6nfeIdMQBHosVignK3vL9RzcDbh2oNCUtzVA7f1og/edit#gid=1259436206), which shows the name of the parts, the amount needed per part, and where you can buy them via Amazon.

## Buying devices

If you'd rather buy a pre-assembled device, you can purchase [here](https://breathesafe-llc.myshopify.com/products/laminair).

### Modifying the pieces

[OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/) is a tool for programmers to programmatically create 3D-printable designs. See [OpenSCAD tutorials](https://openscad.org/documentation.html) to learn how to use the tool. OpenSCAD lets someone edit `.scad` files. The 3D printable models then get exported from there as STL files, which essentially contain information about shapes and curves. Finally, these STL files are then transformed into G-Code, which contains all the steps for a 3D printer to print the objects. I use [PrusaSlicer](https://www.prusa3d.com/page/prusaslicer_424/) to convert STL files to G-Code. Once that is done, the G-Code is then exported to an SD card, which is then finally inserted to a 3D printer. A fine choice is Prusa's MK3S+.

## DIY

If you are interested in printing out the pieces, please take a look at [Printables](https://www.printables.com/model/716902-laminair/), which shows the 3D-printable parts in STL format.

The rest of the pieces are listed
[here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wJ6nfeIdMQBHosVignK3vL9RzcDbh2oNCUtzVA7f1og/edit#gid=1259436206), which shows the name of the parts, the amount needed per part, and where you can buy them via Amazon.


### Putting things together

Once you've printed all the parts, you can start assemble the parts together. Watch the [Assembly walkthrough on YouTube](https://youtu.be/tnxe13Jcs5g).


## Buying devices

If you'd rather buy a pre-assembled device, you can purchase [here](https://breathesafe-llc.myshopify.com/products/laminair).

If you don't have access to a 3D printer but still would like to save some money on labor, you'll be able to purchase them through [Breathesafe LLC](https://breathesafe-llc.myshopify.com/) at some point.

Safety
  - For each scenario: (sitting, walking, running)
    - How fast does the average person breathe when doing the above?
      - We need to have the output of the device be larger than this. Otherwise, they are breathing more of unfiltered air.
      - Since we have a loose-fitting PAPR, the output of the device might have to be significantly larger than the amount being breathed in, as a bunch of the output might go somewhere else.

    - What dial position does that CFM correspond to?
      - What is the relationship between dial and CFM in general with my setup?

      - How accurate and precise is the anemometer?

    - What is the overall fit factor of the PAPR?
    - What is the overall fit factor of the PAPR with visor?

What can we improve to make the PM measurements more accurate?
  - ground truth data (FEM), see how it relates to the LCS data. Use an appropriate function to smooth-out the bias-correction factors




Cost-effectiveness (Safety / $)
  - How often do you need to change the filters?

- build bigger holes for the screws holding the C-clamp
- add Breathesafe logo
- buy hex screws instead?
  - Easy to screw when spacing is tight
- find a battery that has
  - USB support
  - can be taken on the airplane
    (Not Lithium-Ion-based)
- add battery casing
  - velcro to strap the battery?
- something to make wiring nicer - cable management / ties - velcro?
- add louvers

The activated carbon filter that comes with the Coway should remove some of the gasses, but I havenâ€™t studied it enough to get a sense of what
